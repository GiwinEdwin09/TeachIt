Note: DO NOT RUN 'reflex init'. It will create a new reflex.dev project inside and mess up the whole project. In the directory with rxconfig.py, run 'reflex run'.
Also when pushing a new change, DO NOT have any OpenAI keys or any other keys. This will prevent it from being pushed and is a security problem.
